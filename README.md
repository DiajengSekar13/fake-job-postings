# Fake Job Postings

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of **job postings** to identify fraudulent job listings using **Logistic Regression**. After evaluating the model's performance, a **Streamlit-based GUI** was developed for user interaction and visualization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis of job posting characteristics.
- **Logistic Regression** model for fraud detection.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Streamlit-based GUI** for easy data input and prediction visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression)
- **Streamlit** (GUI development)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-job-postings.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Upload or enter job posting details in the **Streamlit UI**.
- The Logistic Regression model will predict whether the job posting is real or fraudulent.
- View prediction results and model evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various job postings with labeled fraudulent cases. More details can be found [here](link_to_dataset).
